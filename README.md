# LGA-Net-ICCV-2025

We are excited to announce that our work on image colorization, "LGA-Net: Learning Local and Global Affinities for Sparse Scribble based Image Colorization", has been officially accepted by ICCV 2025.​

This repository will serve as the home for the code and trained models associated with our research. We are currently preparing the materials and will release the code sequentially in the near future.​

Stay tuned for updates!
